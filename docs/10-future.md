# The Roadmap to General Purpose Robots

Robotics ka mustaqbil ab "General Purpose" machines mein hai.

* **Household Helpers:** Robots jo ghar ke kaam kaaj mein madad karenge.
* **Human-Robot Collaboration:** Factories mein insano aur robots ka mil kar kaam karna.
* **Global Learning:** Urdu jaise local languages mein robotics seekhna taake har koi seekh sakay.


#  General Purpose Physical AI

We are transitioning from single-purpose factory arms to **General Purpose Robots** that can learn anything.

## 10.1 Human-Robot Collaboration
The next decade will see humanoids working in hospitals, warehouses, and homes. Physical AI ensures they are safe to be around.

## 10.2 Foundation Models for Motion
Just as LLMs mastered text, **Motion Foundation Models** are mastering physics. Robots will soon learn to cook or fold clothes just by watching a human do it once.

## 10.3 Conclusion: Education for All
By providing these tools in multiple languages like **Urdu**, we ensure the robotics revolution is global.
