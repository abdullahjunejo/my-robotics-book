# Generative AI & Robotics Foundation Models

Generative AI is no longer limited to chatbots; it is now the primary "Cognitive Engine" for Physical AI systems. This chapter explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Models are transformed into robotic actions.

---

## 2.1 From Text to Motion (Vision-Language-Action)
Traditional robots required thousands of lines of C++ code for a single task. Modern Physical AI uses **VLA (Vision-Language-Action)** models.
* **Vision:** The robot sees an image of a cluttered table.
* **Language:** The user says, "Pick up the green object."
* **Action:** The AI predicts the exact joint torques to move the arm.

## 2.2 Behavior Cloning and Imitation Learning
One of the most powerful techniques today is **Behavior Cloning**. Instead of programming the robot, we show it videos of humans performing tasks.
1. **Data Collection:** Thousands of videos are fed into a Transformer model.
2. **Tokenization:** Robotic movements are turned into "tokens," just like words in a sentence.
3. **Inference:** The robot "predicts" the next movement based on the visual sequence.

## 2.3 LLMs as Robotic Task Planners
LLMs are excellent at breaking down complex goals into sub-tasks.
* **Goal:** "Make me a cup of tea."
* **LLM Decomposition:** 1. Locate the kettle.
  2. Move to the sink.
  3. Fill water.
  4. Turn on the stove.

## 2.4 Code Example: LLM-Driven Task Execution
Professional systems use Python APIs to connect LLMs to robotic controllers.

```python
import json

class GenerativeBrain:
    def __init__(self, model_name="Robotics-GPT"):
        self.model = model_name
        self.knowledge_base = "Physical AI Dynamics"

    def translate_command_to_action(self, natural_language_command):
        # Simulating an LLM processing a command
        print(f"Processing command: '{natural_language_command}'")
        
        # Example Output: Mapping language to robotic coordinates
        action_plan = {
            "task": "pick_and_place",
            "coordinates": [0.45, -0.12, 0.88],
            "velocity": "slow",
            "gripper_force": "medium"
        }
        return json.dumps(action_plan, indent=2)

brain = GenerativeBrain()
print("Action Plan Generated by AI:")
print(brain.translate_command_to_action("Pick up the red circuit board gently"))
